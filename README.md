**Analysis**
1. ✅ Data Collection: 

    Gather transaction data from your retail store, including details of what customers purchased in each transaction.

2. ✅ Data Preparation: 
    Organize the data into a format suitable for analysis. Typically, this data is structured as a table with rows representing transactions and columns representing different products.

3. ✅ Association Rule Mining: 
    Use algorithms like Apriori or FP-growth to identify frequent itemsets. These are combinations of products that are often bought together. For instance, you might discover that customers who buy bread often buy butter as well.

4. ✅ Rule Generation: 
    Based on frequent itemsets, generate association rules. These rules indicate the likelihood of one product being purchased when another is bought. Common metrics used to assess rules include support, confidence, and lift.

5. ✅ Interpretation: 
    Review and interpret the generated rules. Focus on those with high confidence and lift values, as they are more reliable and actionable.

6. ✅ Application: 
    Use the insights gained from market basket analysis to inform business decisions. For instance, you might place frequently purchased items closer together in the store or create targeted promotions.
